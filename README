==================
MyM - avant CMS 
==================

MyM is thought for light-weighted, very customized applications that need an internet base point. It follows ideas similar to other frameworks, but it is smaller,  and does not need necessarly MySQL. Just copy your site/application directory on your server!

I keep developing this in the spare time, since 2005!  
It is still alpha, perhaps I haven't had so much spare time, finally :)

------------------
Features:
------------------

* very fast prototyping:    
  1. starting from data models (here called STRUCTURES)
     -> automatic creation of the tables in the database 
     -> automatic logic for controllers
     -> automatic views for input / outputs       
  2. STRUCTURES can be then extended/customized using MODULES,
     for example overloading the controller/view functions  

* plain text or MySQL databases 

* chronological management of content
* multilingual management of content
* automatic language recognition

* light-weighted and generic admin control panel

* user management, authentication
* privilege level management
  - Read / Write / Delete, Own / All 
  - to a given data model, 
  - to a single field of the data model,
* captcha test when not logged

* object-oriented approach, but with some attention could be used as MVC

* bbcode-like text content
* upload management
* resize image functions
* caching functions  

* light-weighted javascript error check for forms
