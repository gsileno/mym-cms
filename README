-------------

This is a CMS I keep developing in the spare time (since 2005!).  
It is still alpha, and it has not been used for rigorous productions. 
Perhaps I haven't had so much spare time, finally :)

------------------
Features:
------------------

* very fast prototyping:    
1. starting from data models (here called STRUCTURES)
   -> automatic creation of the tables in the database 
   -> automatic logic for controllers
   -> automatic views for input / outputs       
2. STRUCTURES can be then extended/customized using MODULES,
   for example overloading the controller/view functions  

* plain text or MySQL databases 

* chronological management of content
* multilingual management of content
* automatic language recognition

* light-weighted and generic admin control panel

* user management, authentication
* privilege level management
  - Read / Write / Delete, Own / All 
  - to a given data model, 
  - to a single field of the data model,
* captcha test when not logged

* could be used as MVC-oriented, but it not strict at all

* bbcode-like text content
* upload / resize image functions
* chaching functions  

* light-weighted javascript error check for forms

Notes:
-------

"avant", because I consider it "before" a CMS. 
It shares the same ideas behind other frameworks, but it is littler, 
and does not need MySQL. Just copy your site/application on your 
hosting directory!

it is thought for light-weighted, very customized applications 
that need an internet base point.
